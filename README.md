# Retro-Snake
Play the web version: [Retro-Snake](https://giuffridino.github.io/retro-snake/)

First game completed using the RayLib library. 

It's a simple setup, but it allowed me to apply key game logic features such as:
- Game loop
- Animating a tile-based snake character
- Drawing text and textures on screen
- Playing background music and SFX
- Singleton pattern
- GameState pattern
